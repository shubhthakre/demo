## My JSON Server
Fake Online REST server for teams

# How to
. Create a repository on GitHub (<your-username>/<your-repo>)
. Create a db.json file
. Visit https://my-json-server.typicode.com/<your-username>/<your-repo> to access your server
No registration. Nothing to install.

# Example
You can check the following server as an example:
https://my-json-server.typicode.com/typicode/demo

# Beta
For the moment, the project is in beta which means many things may change or break:

. URLs may change
. Service may be down
. Authentication may be added later
etc...
Use it at your own risk. If you need a reliable solution, please install JSON Server.

# Limits
To be able to provide a free service to as many people as possible during this phase, the project comes with a few limits:

. Changes are faked and aren't persisted (just like JSONPlaceholder)
. Requests are cached (1 minute)
. db.json has limits
. All servers are public
. Private GitHub repositories aren't supported (yet)

# Roadmap
I hope to be able to support private repositories later and plan to improve this service regularly. To be notified of updates, you can follow me on Twitter @typicode.
